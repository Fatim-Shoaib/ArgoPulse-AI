        "key_components": [
            "Virtual Environment (.venv): Managed dependencies using pip (as shown in the site-packages).",
            "Source Code (machine_learning_engineering/): Contains the main application logic.",
            "Configuration Files: Poetry used for dependency management (pyproject.toml, poetry.lock), and environment variables (.env, .env.example).",
            "Documentation (machine_learning_engineering/documentations/):  Markdown files detailing different aspects of the project.",
            "Tasks (machine_learning_engineering/tasks/): Contains data and task descriptions, suggesting a data-driven approach.",
            "Sub-agents (machine_learning_engineering/sub_agents/): modular sub-agents such as ensembling, initialization, refinement, and submission. This implies an agent-based architecture.",
            "Shared Libraries (machine_learning_engineering/shared_libraries/): Reusable utility functions and configurations.",
            "Pytest Cache (.pytest_cache/): Cache from pytest runs."
